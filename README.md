# Unfied_pasta_eos

These are the unified equation of states (EOS) calculated with the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. 
The core part is calculated using RMF+ inner_crust (include pasta) using CLDM + oter_crust using HFB26+AME2020 data.
All the EOSs reproduce the mass of the neutron star $``\sim 2 M_\odot``$.

If you are uisng these EOSs for your future calculations, please cite the following article. 
For unified EOSs without pasta phases (only spherical case (please see https://github.com/hcdas/Unified_eos).
This calculation use the Thomas Carreau pasta code.
The eos_unified_XXX.dat contains three columns (i) baryon density (fm^{-3}), (ii) energy density (MeV/fm^{3}), and (iii) pressure (MeV/fm^{3}) respectively.
