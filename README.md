# Unified_pasta_eos

These are the unified equation of states (EOS) calculated with the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model. 
The core part is calculated using RMF+ inner_crust (include pasta) using CLDM + outer_crust using HFB26+AME2020 data.
All the EOSs reproduce the mass of the neutron star $``\sim 2 M_\odot``$.

If you are using these EOSs for your future calculations, please cite the following article. 
For unified EOSs without pasta phases (only spherical case (please see https://github.com/hcdas/Unified_eos).
This calculation use the Thomas Carreau pasta code.
The eos_unified_XXX.dat contains three columns (i) baryon density (fm^-3), (ii) energy density (MeV/fm^3), and (iii) pressure (MeV/fm^3) respectively.

Unified EOSs only with spherical nuclei in the crust, please see https://github.com/hcdas/Unfied_eos

If you are willing to use these EOSs for your calculations, please cite the following article
